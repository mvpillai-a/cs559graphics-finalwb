Advanced Thing: 
- Complex movement for roaming horse
- Complex Object for ship: please I spent 3 hours trying to understand Polyhedron and lathe geometry for the sails and bow of the ship >:(
- Animated Shader for flowing water? (maybe not complex enough-effect gained from just changing offset in stepworld)
- Particle effect: Chimney Smoke
